## Getting Started

To get started DM Matic on Discord to be added to the knowledgebase team. After a team leader has added you to the team you can start editing the knowledgebase.

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the repository with Visual Studio Code or other IDE.

### Editing the Knowledgebase

1. You always push to your own branch. It will be your firstname-lastname. This is because we are limited to one contributor per organisation.
2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch.
3. Make your changes to the knowledgebase.
4. Commit your changes to **your** branch.
5. Create a pull request to the `main` branch.
6. Wait for a team leader to review your changes.   

### Tips and Notes

1. The knowledgebase uses formatting available here: https://help.noxity.io/essentials/markdown - This will be later moved to Confluence.
2. If you are using Visual Studio Code, we reccomend setting syntax checker to "HTML" for .mdx files within this project. This will help you see any errors in your formatting.
