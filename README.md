## Getting Started with contributing

Contributions to this project are currenly limited to Noxity staff only. Thus these instructions serve informational purpose only to the public. Soon we plan to open issue and suggestion system for everyone.

To get started message project leader on Discord to be added to the knowledgebase team. After a team leader has added you to the team you can start editing the knowledgebase.

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the repository with Visual Studio Code or other IDE.

### Editing the Knowledgebase

1. You always push to your own branch. It will be your firstname-lastname.
2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch.
3. Make your changes to the knowledgebase.
4. Commit your changes to **your** branch.
5. Create a pull request to the `main` branch.
6. Wait for a project maintainer to review your changes.

### Tips and Notes

1. The knowledgebase uses formatting available here: https://help.noxity.io/essentials/markdown
2. If you are using Visual Studio Code, we recommend setting syntax checker to "HTML" for .mdx files within this project. This will help you see any errors in your formatting.
